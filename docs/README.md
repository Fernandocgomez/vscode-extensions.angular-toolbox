## Why Choose Angular Toolbox? ü§î

In a collaborative environment, consistency is everything. In solo projects, speed is paramount. Angular Toolbox is built to deliver both. It replaces the repetitive, error-prone cycle of command-line generation with a powerful, intuitive UI.

- **üöÄ Accelerate Your Workflow:** Scaffold components, services, pipes, directives, and guards in seconds, directly from the editor's context menu. No more context switching or memorizing CLI flags.
- **ü§ù Enforce Project Consistency:** Use custom EJS templates to ensure every new file adheres to your team's architecture and coding standards. Eliminate style drift before it starts.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Simplify Configuration:** Manage your project's component prefix and extension settings through a straightforward configuration file, keeping your setup clear and version-controlled.

## Features

### ‚ö° Right-Click Generation

Our powerful and user-friendly generator is available right where you need it‚Äîin the folder context menu.

- **Generate Schematics from Scratch:**
  - Components
  - Services
  - Pipes
  - Directives
  - Route Guards
- **Act on Existing Files:**
  - Generate **specification files** (`.spec.ts`) for existing Angular elements.
  - Generate **Storybook stories files** (`.stories.ts`) for existing components.

### ü§ñ Advanced Automation (Opt-in)

Supercharge your workflow with powerful automation, disabled by default and easily enabled in your `config.json`.

- **Automatic Storybook Generation:** When enabled, the extension will automatically generate a Storybook stories file every time you create a new component.
- **Automatic Barrel File Management:** When enabled, the extension automatically appends an export statement for newly generated files to an `index.ts` barrel file in the target directory. If `index.ts` doesn't exist, it will be created for you.

### üóÇÔ∏è Customizable EJS Templates

Take full control of your code generation. Angular Toolbox uses **EJS templating** to let you define precisely how every file is scaffolded.

To override the default templates, simply create a `.angular-toolbox` folder in your project's root. Inside this folder, add your custom `.ejs` files. The extension will automatically use your templates instead of the defaults.

### üõ†Ô∏è Centralized Configuration Management

Take control of your workspace with a simple `config.json` file.

- **Define Base Configuration:** Set up extension-wide settings that can be shared across your team.
- **Manage Component Prefix:** View and manage your project's component prefix directly from your workspace settings.
- **Toggle Automation:** Easily enable or disable automatic Storybook generation and barrel file updates to fit your project's needs.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before you begin, please ensure your project meets the following requirements:

- **Angular v14** or higher.
- The extension works best when following the official **Angular file structure and naming conventions**.
- We recommend adhering to the [**Angular Style Guide**](https://angular.dev/style-guide#introduction).
