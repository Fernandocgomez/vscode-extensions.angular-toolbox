### Your First Code Contribution

Ready to contribute some code? Hereâ€™s how to set up your environment and submit a pull request.

#### Development Setup

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vscode-extensions.angular-toolbox.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate** to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd vscode-extensions.angular-toolbox
    ```
4.  **Install** dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Open** the project in VS Code.
6.  Press `F5` to **run** the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

#### Pull Request Process

1.  **Create a new branch** from the `main` branch. Please use a descriptive name that follows our conventions.

    **Branch Naming Conventions:**
    - `added/<feature-name>`: for new features (e.g., `added/add-module-template`)
    - `changed/<feature-name>`: for changes to existing features (e.g., `changed/update-component-logic`)
    - `chore/<chore-name>`: for miscellaneous changes (e.g., `chore/upgrade-dependencies-ejs`)
    - `fixed/<issue-or-description>`: for bug fixes (e.g., `fixed/42-path-error`)
    - `security/<vulnerability-description>`: for security fixes.
    - `doc/<topic>`: for documentation (e.g., `doc/update-contributing-guide`)
    - `test/<component-or-feature>`: for adding tests (e.g., `test/component-generation`)
    - `refactor/<component-name>`: for code refactoring.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b added/my-awesome-feature
    ```

2.  **Make your changes**. Write clean, readable code and add comments where necessary.

3.  **Commit your changes**. We follow a convention for commit messages that helps us automate changelogs and releases. Please use one of the following types in your commit message:

    **Commit Types:**
    - `added`: For new features.
    - `changed`: For changes in existing functionality.
    - `deprecated`: For soon-to-be removed features.
    - `removed`: For now removed features.
    - `fixed`: For any bug fixes.
    - `security`: In case of vulnerabilities.
    - `doc`: For documentation-only changes.
    - `test`: For adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    - `chore`: For miscellaneous changes like updating dependencies or pipeline configurations.

    The commit message format should be `type(scope): subject`.
    - The `scope` (between parenthesis) describes the module or part of the extension being changed. Examples include `templates`, `common-capabilities`, `extension-config`, or `root` for files in the project's root directory.

    Example:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "added(templates): add route guard template"
    git commit -m "fixed(extension config): resolve path issue on Windows"
    git commit -m "doc(docs): clarify commit scope conventions"
    ```

4.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin added/my-awesome-feature
    ```

5.  **Open a Pull Request** (PR) to the `main` branch of the original `Fernandocgomez/vscode-extensions.angular-toolbox` repository.

6.  In your PR description, provide a clear explanation of the changes. If your PR fixes an existing issue, please reference it using `Closes #issue-number`.

7.  We will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it once it's ready. Thank you for your contribution!

## A Note on the README file

The main `README.md` file is the front door to our project. When adding a new feature or changing existing functionality, please consider if the `README.md` needs to be updated as well. This could include new screenshots, updated feature lists, or changes to installation and usage instructions. Keeping the README clear and up-to-date is crucial for our users.
