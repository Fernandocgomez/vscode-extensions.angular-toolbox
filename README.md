## Why Choose Angular Toolbox? ü§î

In a collaborative environment, consistency is everything. In solo projects, speed is paramount. Angular Toolbox is built to deliver both. It replaces the repetitive, error-prone cycle of command-line generation with a powerful, intuitive UI.

- **üöÄ Accelerate Your Workflow:** Scaffold components, services, pipes, and directives in seconds, directly from the editor's context menu. No more context switching or memorizing CLI flags.
- **ü§ù Enforce Project Consistency:** Use custom EJS templates to ensure every new file adheres to your team's architecture and coding standards. Eliminate style drift before it starts.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Simplify Configuration:** Manage your project's component prefix and extension settings through a straightforward configuration file, keeping your setup clear and version-controlled.

## Features

### ‚ö° Right-Click Schematics Generator

Our powerful and user-friendly generator is available right where you need it‚Äîin the folder context menu.

- **Components:** Scaffold components with options for custom templates.
- **Services:** Generate service boilerplate instantly.
- **Pipes:** Create new pipes using your predefined templates.
- **Directives:** Scaffold directives with a single click.

### üóÇÔ∏è Customizable EJS Templates

Take full control of your code generation. Angular Toolbox uses **EJS templating** to let you define precisely how every file is scaffolded.

To override the default templates, simply create a `.angular-toolbox` folder in your project's root. Inside this folder, add your custom `.ejs` files. The extension will automatically use your templates instead of the defaults.

### üõ†Ô∏è Centralized Configuration Management

Take control of your workspace with a simple `config.json` file.

- **Define Base Configuration:** Set up extension-wide settings that can be shared across your team.
- **Manage Component Prefix:** View and manage your project's component prefix directly from your workspace settings, ensuring all new components are correctly named.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before you begin, please ensure your project meets the following requirements:

- **Angular v14** or higher.
- The extension works best when following the official **Angular file structure and naming conventions**.
- We recommend adhering to the [**Angular Style Guide**](https://angular.dev/style-guide#introduction).
